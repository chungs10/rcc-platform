# Rensselaer Cybersecurity Collaboratory (RCC) - Website & CTF Management System

A comprehensive full-stack development project for the Rensselaer Cybersecurity Collaboratory (RCC). The goal was to solve three core problems: no public-facing presence, no centralized knowledge base for CTF write-ups, and a lack of an interactive front-end for challenges.

*   *Frontend:* React, Bootstrap
*   *Backend:* Node.js, Express.js
*   *Database:* MongoDB
*   *Authentication:* RPI CAS (Central Authentication Service)
